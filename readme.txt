Homework Assignment #1: Data Types


Details:

What's your favorite song?

Think of all the attributes that you could use to describe that song. That is: all of it's details or "meta-data". These are attributes like "Artist", "Year Released", "Genre", "Duration", etc. Think of as many different characteristics as you can.

In your text editor, create an empty file and name it song.js

Now, within that file, list all of the attributes of the song, one after another, by creating variables for each attribute, and giving each variable a value. Here's an example:

```
var genre = "Jazz"

```

Give each variable its own line. Then, after you have listed the variables, console.log them.

 For example:

```

var artist = "Dave Brubeck"
var genre = "Jazz"
var durationInSeconds = 328

console.log(Artist);
console.log(Genre);
console.log(DurationInSeconds);


```
Your actual assignment should be significantly longer than the example above. Think of as many characteristics of the song as you can. Important: Try to use Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Objects and Arrays!

Extra Credit:

By this far in the course you probably intuitively figured out how comments work. There are two types of comments:

Single line comments: They start with two forward slashes, like so

 // I am a single-line comment

Multi-line comments: They begin with a forward-slash and an asterisk, and end with the same characters in the reverse order.

/*
I am a
Multi-line comment
*/

For extra credit, add comments to your code, that explain the different attributes. Also add a title to the top of your file explaining what the file is, and what it's for.

Turning it In:

One of the first slides in this course is called "How to Turn in Homework" review that slide for details on how to send your assignment to us (and receive a grade).
